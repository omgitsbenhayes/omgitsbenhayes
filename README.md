### Hi there! 👋

Many people know I am fascinated by solving problems with technology and data. Naturally, I studied data scientist and artificial intelligence. Carnegie Mellon grad. Currently, I work at [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) where I help organizations large and small solve challenging problems with data + AI. 👨🏻‍💻

I also blog on my [website](https://benhay.es/) about technology, AI, ML, and anything I find captivating.
