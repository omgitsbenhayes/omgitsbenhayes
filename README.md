### Hi there! 👋

Many people know I am fascinated by solving problems with technology and data. Naturally, I studied data science and artificial intelligence. Carnegie Mellon grad. Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.databricks.com/" target="_blank">Databricks</a> where I help organizations leverage the world's first <a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/data-intelligence-platform" target="_blank">Data Intelligence Platform</a> to solve challenging problems with data + AI. 👨🏻‍💻
